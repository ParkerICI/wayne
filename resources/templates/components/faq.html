The BRUCE Data Portal is an open-access platform designed to share the multi-omic data generated from the BRUCE study, including transcriptomic, proteomic, and N-glycome analyses. The data has been meticulously curated, providing insights into tumor and immune cell composition, glycan expression, and other important spatial and molecular signitures across glioma subtypes. The portal allows researchers, clinicians, and bioinformaticians to interactivly explore tumor microenvironment features alongside clinically annotated metadata, drawing meaningful insights that could inform future research and clinical decision-making.

		Yes, you can. There are several options available:
		<ul>
<li>In the “Raw Data Access” tab, you can download the 
 <ol>
 <li> Entire feature data calculated for our study. This is a large parquet file and the format is open source, column oriented data file format that is compatible with many different programming platforms. 
<li> Download the raw single cell tables with marker expression values obtained from the MIBI platform
<li>You can request to download the entire MIBI image library through us or download the images through the IDR platform (link)
</ol  
  <li> In the “Visualization” tab, you can download specific selected features and comparisons by clicking on the download icon associated with the visualizations.This flexibility allows users to access and analyze the data in a manner that best suits their research needs.
