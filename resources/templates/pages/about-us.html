                The Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy (PICI) is a 501c3 nonprofit research institute headquartered in San Francisco. Founded in 2016 through a $250 million gift from tech entrepreneur and philanthropist Sean Parker, PICI embodies a bold, innovative approach to cancer research.<br>
<strong>Our mission is to accelerate the development of breakthrough immune therapies to turn all cancers into curable diseases.</strong><br>
PICI represents an unprecedented collaboration between the world’s leading immunotherapy research institutes. The PICI Network includes Stanford Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, University of California San Francisco, University of Pennsylvania, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Gladstone Institutes and Weill Cornell Medicine. We also support top researchers at institutions such as University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; City of Hope; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Institute for Systems Biology; and Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. By forging alliances with academic, industry and nonprofit partners, PICI makes big bets on bold research. We don't just fund research—we accelerate it at every step, focusing on high-impact projects with the greatest potential to benefit patients. Our approach combines cutting-edge science, collaboration and a relentless commitment to turning all cancers into curable diseases.</p>

PICI is addressing the urgent need for brain tumor treatments, which requires immunotherapies that are cancer-specific and able to overcome the immunosuppressive environment. A key barrier is lack of insight into the phenotypic and spatial heterogeneity within various brain tumor types. In 2019, PICI and our funding partners ACGT, launched BRUCE (BRain tUmor heterogeneity deCiphered by high dimEnsional multi-omic analysis), a research program bringing together a consortium of world class researchers to utilize cutting-edge multi-omics technologies and cell therapy expertise to identify new targets for aggressive brain tumors

We are committed to advancing the understanding and treatment of primary brain tumors—some of the most lethal cancers affecting both adults and children. Despite decades of research, effective therapies remain elusive, and survival rates have not significantly improved. To address this challenge, we have assembled one of the largest and most diverse glioma tissue cohorts. This cohort includes adult and pediatric patients, covering treatment-naive, post-immunotherapy, and recurrent cases. Utilizing cutting-edge high-dimensional imaging technologies, we have created a comprehensive spatial multi-omic atlas of gliomas, focusing on better understanding the tumor microenvironment (TME) and unraveling the mechanisms of treatment resistance.
